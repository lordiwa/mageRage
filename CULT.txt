MAGE RAGE ARCADE GAME DEVELOPMENT SUMMARY
COMPLETED SYSTEMS:
Unity 2D project setup with proper Git structure. Player flying movement controller with 8-directional input, smooth acceleration/deceleration, boundary constraints. ManaSystem component with 100 max mana, automatic regeneration after 1s delay, spend/restore functionality. Input System configured for 6-button arcade controller using zero delay USB encoder, mapped to Joystick button0-5. BaseAbility ScriptableObject framework for creating abilities. Projectile system with Projectile.cs script handling movement, collision detection, lifetime management. Created 6 abilities: KineticBlast, FireBolt, IceShard, Lightning, Heal, Shield with individual mana costs and cooldowns. All abilities spawn projectiles that shoot forward horizontally regardless of player movement direction. Mana consumption and ability cooldowns working correctly. Debug systems active for troubleshooting input and ability activation.
PROJECT STRUCTURE:
Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs, Assets/Scripts/Managers/ManaSystem.cs, Assets/Scripts/Abilities/BaseAbility.cs and Projectile.cs. BasicProjectile prefab with SpriteRenderer, Rigidbody2D, CircleCollider2D, Projectile script. Six ability ScriptableObject assets configured with BasicProjectile as effectPrefab.
HARDWARE INTEGRATION:
Zero delay USB encoder recognized as generic joystick in Unity. 8-directional arcade stick for movement, 6 arcade buttons for abilities. Input Actions properly bound to Joystick device only, no keyboard/gamepad interference.
NEXT DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES:

Create distinct projectile prefabs for each ability type with different colors, speeds, effects
Add particle systems for projectile trails and hit effects
Implement enemy spawning system with health/damage mechanics
Create UI system: mana bar display, ability cooldown indicators, arcade-style interface
Add collision boundaries and environment objects
Implement scoring/progression system
Audio integration for ability sounds and background music
Screen boundaries for projectile cleanup
Attract mode and high score system for arcade cabinet deployment

CURRENT STATE:
Fully functional flying mage character with 6-button ability system shooting projectiles forward in sidescroller style. Ready for content expansion and visual polish.
